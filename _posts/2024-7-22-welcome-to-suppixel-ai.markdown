## Effectiveness Demonstrated

To showcase the power of SupPixel AI, we’ve included some before-and-after images below. These examples demonstrate how our technology can dramatically improve image quality, making every detail pop and bringing your visuals to life.

### Example 1: Low-Resolution to High-Resolution (AIGC Images)

**Before**: The original low-resolution AI-generated content (AIGC) images often lack clarity, with details appearing blurred and indistinct.

**After**: SupPixel AI enhances these images significantly, with a notable improvement in the eye area. The eyes now appear crisp and vibrant, adding a lifelike quality to the images.

### Example 2: Classic TV Show Scene Restoration

**Before**: Scenes from old TV shows often appear faded and blurry due to the limitations of recording technology at the time.

**After**: SupPixel AI brings these scenes back to life. The restored images are vivid and detailed, making the characters and settings look as if they were filmed with modern technology.
