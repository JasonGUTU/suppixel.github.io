Welcome to our journey into the world of image processing! In this blog post, we'll introduce you to some exciting adjustable parameters in our software that can help you easily enhance your images. Don't worry, we'll explain each feature in simple terms, so it's easy to understand. Ready? Let's go!

### Upscale Factor: Resolution Scaling Multiplier

First, let's talk about image resolution. Image resolution refers to the amount of detail an image holds and is typically measured in pixels. The higher the resolution, the clearer and more detailed the image appears.

High resolution is especially useful when you want to print large-scale photos, create high-quality digital art, or restore old images with more clarity. For instance, if you're working on a project that requires close-up details, like a poster or a fine art piece, having a high-resolution image ensures that the final product looks sharp and professional. By using the Upscale Factor, you can increase an image's resolution and size. For example, if you want to breathe new life into an old photo, you can adjust this multiplier. However, keep in mind that using a higher multiplier may require more processing time. For those aged and deteriorated photos, we recommend starting with a 1x multiplier to achieve the best results without rushing things.

### Sampler: Sampling Modes

We offer three sampling modes for you to choose from:

- __Lightning Mode__: This mode is super fast, perfect for when you're in a hurry.
- __Balance Mode__: This mode strikes a balance between speed and quality, offering a good compromise when you need both efficiency and detail.
- __Ultimate Perception__: This mode delivers top-notch visual quality, ideal for those who demand the highest level of detail.

Whether you're rushing to finish a project, aiming for perfection, or looking for a balanced approach, there's a mode that's just right for you!

### Prioritizing: Setting Priorities

Here, you can choose whether to prioritize the realism of the image or focus on adding fine textures:

- __Fidelity__: This mode faithfully preserves every detail of the input image.
- __Quality__: This mode emphasizes details and can add extra textures, such as wrinkles. Sometimes, these added details can bring a unique charm to the image.

We've prepared a set of portrait images as examples. In Fidelity mode, every detail from the original image is accurately preserved. In Quality mode, the emphasis on facial details sometimes introduces additional features, like wrinkles, which can add character to the portrait. The best approach is to experiment with different settings for each image to find the perfect balance.

### Texture Richness
Looking for more details, like making wrinkles and spots more noticeable? Adjust the Texture Richness setting! But be careful—setting it too high might make the image deviate from its original appearance.

We've prepared two sets of images to showcase the fun of this parameter. Lower Texture Richness subtly enhances the textures in your image, which is perfect for capturing the smooth skin of a young woman. Higher Texture Richness adds more realism by generating additional textures and details. This is ideal for portraits of mature men, bringing out just the right amount of skin texture. You can adjust it to get the exact effect you want!

### Creativity

This is a fun feature where the AI model adds extra details to your images, helping you imagine what's within the picture and making them look more realistic. It's particularly effective for heavily damaged images or old photos. However, be cautious! Too much creativity might make the image diverge from the original, but sometimes that might be exactly the effect you're looking for!

### Image Description
This new feature, Image Description, allows for targeted restoration using textual prompts. For example:

- __Case 1__: You can specify the restoration of blurry objects in the distance, making them clearer.

- __Case 2__: You can define the material texture of objects, giving them a specific look and feel.

- __Case 3__: You can adjust the restoration based on high-level semantics, allowing for more nuanced modifications.

This powerful tool lets you fine-tune the restoration process, ensuring that the final result matches your vision perfectly.
